status-tools
============

Generates system status info, intended for use with xmobar. This is a reimplementation of some shell scripts I used to use, written in Haskell for speed and happiness. BSD 3-clause licenced.

The source contains some references which are pretty specific to my system. If you compile and run without modification it'll probably just throw an exception.

To-do
-----

- Implement mocp parser
- Switch to ifconfig
- Be smarter about parsing - parsec?
