status-tools
============

Generates system status info, intended for use with xmobar. This is a reimplementation of some shell scripts I used to use, written in Haskell for speed and happiness.

The file you want is `status-tools.hs`. Everything else here is cruft.

The source contains some references which are pretty specific to my system. If you compile and run without modification it'll probably just throw an exception.
